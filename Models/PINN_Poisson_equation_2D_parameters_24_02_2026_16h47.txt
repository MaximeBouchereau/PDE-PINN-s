Schrödinger equation with mixed first and proper function as initial condition

- Data: 1000
- Batch size: 64
- N_epochs: 1000
- Time for training: 3 min 46 s
- Learning rate: 1e-3

- NN structure: MLP with 2 hidden layers, 128 neurons per hidden layer

- Convergence:
   > Error [L2]:  6.0284E-04
   > Error [H1]:  1.8633E-03

NB: Convergence is made on a grid (r_i cos(theta_j), r_i sin(theta_j)) with i and j in [[0, 50]], 0 <= r_i <= 1 and 0 <= theta_j <= 2*pi
